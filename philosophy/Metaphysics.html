            <div class="title">Metaphysics</div>
        <p> Metaphysics is primarily the study of the real. Studies in metaphysics involve the questions concerning
            what is real and not real. This can extend from abstract existence to concrete. Metaphysics is important 
            for defining the definition of substance, time, space and the implications of things such as the existence of 
            being. 
        </p>
        </div>
        </main>

        <div class="philosopher">
            <div class="Sub-title">Causality</div>
                <p> Causation is the branch of Metaphysics concerned with "cause" and "effect". Causation explores what is (or is not)
                    fundemental in the nature of relations. Unlike other forms of Metaphysics, causation deals much more in the nature of
                    physical observation along with theory. Causation has a direct effect on future events and is heavily dependent on discussions
                    that weight heaviliy on studies of modern physics. 
                </p>
        </div>

       <div class="philosopher">
            <div class="Sub-title">Ontology</div>
                <p> A formal definition of ontology is a set of concepts or a domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. In
                    Metaphysics this is defined as the Categories of Being and Universals. This deals primarily on the conception of the real
                    and what the imposition of universals have on our definition of a universe. An example of this would be "blackness" or "goodness". These
                    two things are traits and if they exist they are present in all things as a quality or attribute. 
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosopher">
            <div class="Sub-title">Space and Time</div>
                <p> Before a theory of relativity defined much of space time as we know of it today it was a primary focus of philosophical work.
                    The discussion of time itelf also falls under a discussion of Ontology. Similar to Descartes duplicity, Time is often argued to
                    either be an illusion due to our position as observers in a universe or as a real feature of our world which takes a direction
                    defining past, present and future.              
                </p>
